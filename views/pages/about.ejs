      <h3>Glenn Clark</h3>
      <p>Hi, my name is Glenn Clark He/him.  I am a software developer living in Seattle WA. I am a veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I last came from the ballroom industry where I was an instructor.  As an instructor I had to be a professional learner, keeping up with the latest techniques and styles.  I love being able to not only grow personally but to help others grow as well.  I am looking for a company that values progress and moving society foward.</p>

      <h3>Jason Dormier</h3>
      <p>Hello, I’m Jason Dormier, I come from the game industry as an artist and designer I was also recently a project manager in the construction industry. My core skill sets are design process and software development, full-stack, and games. I’m always looking for new things to learn, and ways to improve. I love the idea and challenge of making systems more efficient, whether it is software using fewer resources, using design process to improve the development cycle or even my own health. I’m looking to join a software development team to utilize my skills in programming, design process, and project management.</p>

      <h3>Brendan Smith</h3>
      <p>I discovered a deep appreciation for the elegance of complex systems during my studies in evolutionary biology. While working in the guided mountaineering industry, I honed my skills managing multifaceted operations in rapidly changing environments, and learned to draw upon any resources at hand in order to solve a problem. I practiced exhaustive attention to detail, prioritized customer experience, and delivered results under difficult conditions. I see modern computing and data technology as a profoundly powerful and paradigm-shifting tool, and hope to use it to answer questions in ways previously impossible.</p>
