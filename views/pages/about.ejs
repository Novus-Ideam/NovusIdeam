          <h3>Dar-Ci Calhoun</h3>
          <p>Hi! I am a software developer with a recent background in early childhood development and healthcare. What
            I find most rewarding is combining my passion for helping others with my love for growing in my knowledge
            for various sciences and technologies. The technology industry is continually evolving, and I am ecstatic to
            be in a field in which there is always more to learn to ultimately meet the needs of the community and world
            around me. I hope to work on a team where I can utilize my problem-solving skills, as well as a team that is
            utilizing its agency to make the community and world a safer and more equitable place to live.</p>

          <h3>Glenn Elliron Clark</h3>
          <p>Hi, my name is Glenn Clark He/him. I am a software developer living in Seattle WA. I am a veteran who
            served in Iraq and Afghanistan. I last came from the ballroom industry where I was an instructor. As an
            instructor I had to be a professional learner, keeping up with the latest techniques and styles. I love
            being able to not only grow personally but to help others grow as well. I am looking for a company that
            values progress and moving society foward.</p>

          <h3>Jason Dormier</h3>
          <p>Hello, I’m Jason Dormier, I come from the game industry as an artist and designer and most recently a
            Project Manager. My core skill sets in software development are design process and project planning, I love
            writing Javascript and C#. Personal growth is a daily pursuit, I love the challenge and process of breaking
            down and solving complex problems, whether it is with a program using fewer resources, project planning, or
            getting into the nitty-gritty with coding. I’d make a fantastic addition to any software development team
            with my ability to communicate, plan and execute code in a team environment.</p>

          <h3>Brendan Smith</h3>
          <p>I discovered a deep appreciation for the elegance of complex systems during my studies in evolutionary
            biology. While working in the guided mountaineering industry, I honed my skills managing multifaceted
            operations in rapidly changing environments, and learned to draw upon all resources at hand in order to
            solve a problem. I practice exhaustive attention to detail, prioritize customer experience, and delivere
            results under difficult conditions. I see modern computing and data technology as a profoundly powerful and
            paradigm-shifting tool, and hope to use it to answer questions in ways previously impossible.</p>
