        <h3>Dar-Ci Calhoun</h3>
        <p>Hi! I am a software developer with a recent background in early childhood development and healthcare. What I find most rewarding is combining my passion for helping others with my love for growing in my knowledge for various sciences and technologies. The technology industry is continually evolving, and I am ecstatic to be in a field in which there is always more to learn to ultimately meet the needs of the community and world around me. I hope to work on a team where I can utilize my problem-solving skills, as well as a team that is utilizing its agency to make the community and world a safer and more equitable place to live.</p>

      <h3>Brendan Smith</h3>
      <p>I discovered a deep appreciation for the elegance of complex systems during my studies in evolutionary biology. While working in the guided mountaineering industry, I honed my skills managing multifaceted operations in rapidly changing environments, and learned to draw upon all resources at hand in order to solve a problem. I practice exhaustive attention to detail, prioritize customer experience, and delivere results under difficult conditions. I see modern computing and data technology as a profoundly powerful and paradigm-shifting tool, and hope to use it to answer questions in ways previously impossible.</p>
